# 🎯 Filter-Based Recommendation System

This project implements a **Filter-Based Recommendation Engine** to suggest items based on user preferences or item similarity.  
It demonstrates **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** approaches, using real-world datasets.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Recommendation systems are widely used by platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify to personalize user experiences.  
This project builds a **Filter-Based Recommender** that can:

- Recommend products or movies similar to a given item (**Content-Based Filtering**)


---

## 📂 Dataset

You can use any public dataset, for example:
- **Movies Dataset**: [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset]([https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?resource=download&select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv))

**Sample fields**:
- `user_id`
- `item_id`
- `rating`
- `genre` or `category`
- `tags` / `description`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** for similarity measures
- **Cosine Similarity**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data visualization

---

## 📌 Approach

### 1. **Content-Based Filtering**
- Calculate similarity between items using:
  - **TF-IDF** vectorization (for text/genres)
  - **Cosine Similarity** score
- Recommend top N most similar items to a given product/movie
